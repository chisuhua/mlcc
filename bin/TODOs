007.c _X_ Can we get a cmake option for atmi to not install scripts? (Ashwin)

008  ___ [DRIVER] Fix driver to allow for multiple offload targets for
         different archs.  Multiple offload targets already work 
         if on the same arch

009  ___ [SERVICES] Fix vprintfl to only use a single atomic. Requires changes
         to the hsa plugin.  Requires 029

010  _X_ Get a public version of the ATMI source code available (Ashwin)
         Note: ATMI libs and devicelibs are built into the release. 
         This is only a problem for people building from source. (0.5-3 Ashwin)

011  ___ [LIB] Merge hip, cuda2gcn, and some functions from libomptarget
         somewhere in libomptarget/deviceRTLs but not in amdgcn/src. 
         (Jan)

012  ___ [BUILD] Check install and applcation build on systems WITHOUT cuda or rocm.
         Make sure runtime gives a good message if no available runtime 
         for any of the available offload images.
012.b ___ [BUILD] Need to get hip build and install not to depend on HCC compiler.
         Greg Emailed Sam about this. We may remove hipcc from install.
         (Greg 0.5-4) Deferred to 0.5-4. Just state in release notes
         not to use hipcc.
012.c _X_ [BUILD] Build roct and rocr and install in HCC2/lib and set rpath of
          HCC2 to use HCC2/lib. This remove the need to test with different versions of 
          rocm.  We will test with the version of roct and rocr that we build HCC2 with. 

013  _X_ Get stream example working (Greg and Jan 0.5-2)
013.b  _X_ Remove vectorization warnings with SIMD. 
           For now we remove simd in pragma because
           host vectorization is not working

014  _X_ test proxy apps (requires 013) (Andrey 0.5-3) see item 020.

015  ___ [TEST] Test on carrizo and good HSA installed kaveris

016  ___ [TEST] Test SpecAccel benchmark (Andrey requires 013) (Andrey 0.5-4)

017  ___ [DOC] Review READMEs for all examples. Requires 040.

018  _X_ Check the bug report message in hcc2. llvm is 
         “PLEASE submit a bug report to http://llvm.org/bugs/” 
         Our messages should be
         “PLEASE open an issue in https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/hcc2”
         The URL is set in a cmake option. See update to build_hcc2.sh
          (Greg 0.5-2)

019 _X_ Fix the __AMDGCN__ macro to have the gfx name that is being compiled.
019b _X_ Turn on HIP macros with openmp for gfx processors
          (Greg 0.5-2) 

020 _X_  Get status of Chip's OpenMP Apps on AMDGPU and Nvidia (Andrey)
020.b _X_ Get all proxy apps working on amdgcn including update of Makefiles.
         This requires crticial item 039. (Greg 0.5-3)
         Still need to fix snap execution.

024 _X_  Move to latest version of hip development repository (0.5-2)
024.b _X_ Install entire HIP repository

026 _X_  [BUILD] Move to latest version of rocm-device-libs (Greg 0.5-4) deferred to 0.5-4

027 _X_  Fix build_hip.sh script to get version from the version file in this bin directory.
027.b _X_  Fix build_hip.sh script to build and install ALL HIP components. 
         (Greg)
027.c ___  [BUILD] Since hipcc requires HCC, we may want to remove this from install
           (Greg 0.5-4)
027.d ___ [BUILD] What will it take to build_hip.sh without ROCm.  We may need to 
          do a source build of hsaruntime and the thunk library.  To support U of D 
          OpenMP test team, we need to build from source without ROCm. 
027.e ___ Ensure proper use and initialization of CUDA env variable in build_openmp.sh


028 ___ [SERVICES] Update services to use asynchronous streams instead of
                   end-of-kernel services.

029 _X_ Improve performance of end-of-kernel services buffer management (Ashwin 0.5-2)

031 ___ [LIB] Replace __smid to some type of blockid (Ashwin 0.5-X) defer to 0.5-X
        Ashwin talking with Brian about this. We need to understand the
        impact of work group migration to smid AND to openmp runtime getting
        a different smid.

032 ___ [DRIVER] Add current directory to include search path
        DEFER till problem returns.

033 ___ [TEST] Test eigen with hip clang , not with hipcc.

034 _X_ Use cherry picking process to build future dev releases (0.5-3 Greg)
034.b _X_ Create branches HCC2.180821 with development updates 
          on HCC2.180805.  (0.5-3 Greg)

035 _X_ Fix issue_002 (0.5-2) the -g flag turns on dwarf debugging. 
        For openmp this requires the generation of a debug wrapper.  
        The address space management for pointers in this wrapper 
        is failing on both nvptx and amdgcn.  So for now we turn off
        dwarf debugging for both nvptx and amdgcn.  The -g option 
        will still generate dwarf debug information for the host. 

036 _x_ Fix issue_apps_001, find missing functions for lulesh in smoke test issue.
        Current fail is on last link step.(Andrey 0.5-3)
036.b _X_ Remove issue_apps_001 from general smoke makefile. (Andrey 0.5-3)


037 _X_ Check the output of smoketest pfspecifier.  Are values correct?
037.b _X_ Add new smoke test for "char* hello="Hello %s\n"; printf(hello,"World");
        (Andrey 0.5-3)
037.c _X_ Add floating point smoke test that really uses -lm (Andrey 0.5-3)
          This is math_sqrt_float.  Getting this working requires 039.

038 _X_ Have everyone test mygpu and mymcpu test on all amd and nvidia cards
        and ensure all the tables are up to date.  Should we change 
        terminolgy for mygpu from gpu to offload-arch?  Maybe improve the help 
        text for these scripts.  (all 0.5-3)

039 _X_ [BUG] Fix the OpenMP driver so linker flags (-lm -letc) are not treated
        as input files. This is a problem in Driver.cpp ActionBuilder (greg 0.5-3) 
039.b _X_ Remove hard coded -lm from Gnu.cpp. (Greg 0.5-3)

040 _X_ Change the examples makefiles for openmp to use environment variable HCC2_GPU.
        in the same way we updated the proxy makefiles.  This is the common stanza
        we would like people to use in their makefiles.  Lets clearly document this in 
        the hcc2/examples/openmp/README.md.  We need a slightly different stanza
        for c++.  That is, change CFLAGS and CC to CXXFLAGS and CXX.  (Andrey 0.5-3)
040.b _X_ Add debug to other proxy apps.  (Andrey 0.5-3)

041 _X_ Fix warning on build_openmp.sh that only occurs on debug build (Jan 0.5-3)

042 _X_ As a result of 034, we need to carefully compare any new logic introduced 
        in the trunk from last release to current trunk in 
        openmp/libomptarget/deviceRLTS/nvptx   ?? Does this warrent any changes to 
        openmp/libomptarget/deviceRLTS/amdgcn.  (Greg 0.5-3)
        Reviewed, no changes made.
042.b _X_ Likewise we need to review any new logic in 
        openmp/libomptarget/plugins/cuda      ?? Does this warrent any changes to 
        openmp/libomptarget/plugins/hsa  (Greg 0.5-3)
        Reviewed, no changes made however, we did update cuda plugin to
        support a kernel launch trace. See 046. We also added 045.b as a future
        workitem to document how number of teams and threads are set at launch time.
042.c _X_ [OMP] Reconcile new logic in deviceRTLS/nvptx and plugins/cuda in
          deviceRTLS/amdgcn and plugins/hsa respectively after 0.5.3 180821.
          (Greg 0.5-4)  commit fd23577c966ead6b451d2bfe6b75a6a04386bbfe updates
          deviceRTLs/amdgcn.  There are no changes in the cuda plugin to reconcile.

043 _X_  Fix the bundle and unbundle scripts to properly handle .o files that have
         a combination of device bc and host .o (ELF). (Greg 0.5-3). 
         We also updated examples/openmp/README.md to demonstrate how
         unbundle.sh works on .o files. 

044 _X_ fix writeIndex_amode Makefile or source (Andrey 0.5-3)
        Greg fixed the source.

045 ___ [DRIVER] Increase GV_Threads for AMDGCN in GpuGridValues.h and use GpuGridValues.h
        in setting compile time constants in deviceRTLs/amdgcn/src/option.
        Requires a detailed review of device RTL constants MAX_THREADS_PER_TEAM
        WARPSIZE, MAX_SHARED_ARGS, OMP_STATE_COUNT, and especially MAX_SM which
        is currently 64.  We may want to add a MAX_SM to GpuGridValues.h
        (Greg 0.5-4)

045.b ___ [DOC] write a doc on GPU Grid constants that clearly explains the logic
        to determine the number of teams and threads for kernel launch.
        Document should explain the use of LIBOMPTARGET_KERNEL_TRACE
        Requires 046.b.

046 _X_ Create a kernel launch trace facility LIBOMPTARGET_KERNEL_DEBUG not
        tied to using debug library builds. (Greg 0.5-3)
046.b ___ [DEBUG] Add execution mode to the kernel trace, "SPMD", "GENR", "NONE".
         Per discussion with Chip, add requested num_threads and requested
         num_teams and hightlight when different.  Remember the spec requires
         that the actual num_threads and num_teams cannot be more than requested. 
         However, hardware capabilities often restrict it to less than requested, 
         especially num_threads. This fix will be done with TODO 045. 
         Also, change the env var name to LIBOMPTARGET_KERNEL_TRACE.
         We want to restrict _DEBUG environment variables to those that 
         require a build with debug libs. 
         (Greg 0.5-4)
 
047 ___ [LIB] Fix device name in snap.  It currently always prints "Quadro".
        Consider new device hcc2_omp_ API to query device name and memory.
        See if there is something in the openmp 5 spec for this.

048 _X_ [TEST/DOC] Improve mymcpu/mygpu scripts.  Find some source of lspci codes
        for GPU devices that provides a mapping of lspci codes to codenames
        and then find a way to map these codenames to gpu names (sm_XX, gfxYYY etc.)
        Also, lets add the execution of mymcpu/mygpu as a best practice
        install process so users.(Greg 0.5-4).

049 ___ [DOC] Change all the examples and the recommended Makefile stanza to set HCC2_GPU
        based on returned value of $HCC2/bin/mygpu, requires 040 and 038.
        We should only set to a default value gfx803 if mygpu returns unknown
        AND user does not have environment variable HCC2_GPU set to something else.
        Do not do this till we get more confidence in complete tables for GPUs for
        nvidia and radeon GPUs.  Requires 048.

050 ___ [DRIVER] Replace call to select_outline with a call to the actual function in
        our custom linker for gpu phase linking.

051 ___ [DRIVER] Remove the cp commands from the HIP driver that save generated bc
        files to /tmp or just put "#if 0" around them.  (Greg 0.5-4)

052 ___ [LIB] Implement the first Device BC Library to be abbreviated "DBCL"
        Create libm.bc as a DBCL for both amdgcn and nvptx whose interface is the
        standard math library found in  math.h and cmath.h.
        The libm.bc DBCL will support the -lm command line option.
        The amdgcn version of libm.bc will call ocml functions.
        The nvptx will call the __sm__ intrinsics.  This will remove the current need
        to define functions in header files.
        Here is a very cool idea.  Let's demo the construction of libm.bc as an
        example in examples/libdevice/libm
        Then we would add the following to build_libdevice.sh
        to make sure libm.bc is built into the HCC2 installation.

           cp -rp $HCC2_REPO_NAME/examples/libdevice/libm $tmpdir
           cd $tmpdir
           export INSTALL_PATH=$HCC2
           make
           sudo make install

        The libm example should support both -lm and -lmfast.
        This removes additional cmake complexity in our dev repos and provides an example
        for other device library providers to emulate in how to build DBCL.
        We may want to find another example host libs such as -lblas or -latomic
        to build consistent DBCLs.  Any suggestions?
        We want something to demonstrate the ability to build both architecture-specific
        and GPU-specific libraries. Having a makefile install will also demonstrate
        the libdevice naming convention lib<suffix/libdevice/<gpuname>/libX.bc.
        It will also demonstrate how to build debug libraries.
        (Jan 0.5-4)
052.b ___ [DOC] Simplify libdevice/README.md and refer to a new detailed paper called 
          "Device Library Methodologies for Clang"
         (Greg 0.5-4)
052.c _X_ [DRIVER] Add mlink-bit-code clang cc1 options for DBCLs to speed
        up device link phase time and implement the new DBCL strategy.
        DBCL libraries will be inlined as part of the cc1 compile phase using
        the -mlink-bit-code cc1 flag. It is ok to have the output of the cc1 device
        pass be GPU-specific since the driver creates one device pass per requested GPU.
        (Greg 0.5-4)
052.d _X_ Update document with feedback from Wednesday morning multi-company meeting.
        Update description of what happens when unused host libraries are specified.
        That is, when there is a header files and a -l options is specified.
        A good example is #include "mpi.h" with -lmpi.  There are two scenarios
        to document.
           1. What happens when the device code never uses an mpi function.
              Should we generate warnings in the clang driver?
           2. What happens when a user accidentally does not delete the use
              of a host function in his device code.  Where is the fail message?
              How can we generate warnings in the clang driver?
              Should we introduce a new option that requires a DBCL?
        See the README.md in hcc2/examples/libdevice.
052.e ___ Make -Wno-bc-notfound a default to turn off warnings when user specifies
        -l when there is no bc library, e.g. -lmpi currently gets a warning
052.f ___ Write paper called "Device Library Methodolgies for Clang"

030 ___ [DRIVER] Fix llc taking a long time. See if DBCLs from TODO 052
        and -mlink-bit-code improve overall compilation time.

053 _X_ [DOC] Add C++ test to examples/openmp (Andrey 0.5-4)

054 ___ [TEST] Implement functionality to compare the execution results with the golded
        file in Makefiles for test/smoke. This will help to verify the results and
        automate the testing (Andrey)

055 _X_ [BUG] Fix new smoke test pfspecifier_str.c (Greg 0.5-4)
055.b ___ [BUG] Fix compilation of deviceRTL in debug mode where printf
                contains variable length strings. (Greg 0.5-4)
055.c _X_ [TEST] make smoke test pfspecifier_str.c more difficult by using a variable
            length string like that found in libcall.cu. This should cause 
            pfsecifier_str.c to fail until I push my fix for 055.b.  (Andrey 0.5-4)

056 ___ [DRIVER] Fix driver for make -S and -c for amdgcn.  Works for nvidia cuda.
056.a ___ [DRIVER] Double check and fix if needed the behaviour of -S, -emit-llvm and 
        -c flags combinations. At the moment -c alone doesn't produce bundled .o files,
        but along with either -S or -emmit-llvm it does (Greg 0.5-4)

057 ___ [DRIVER?] Big performance difference for test application with and without save-temps. 
        With --save-temps	34.66ms
        Without --save-temps	57.04ms

058 ___ [BUILD] Document HCC2 component build strategy that will include
        how we integrate OpenCL runtime and orignal HCC as components to the
        HCC2 build.

059 __ [DOC] Add instructions to install rpm/deb without root access to install 
       to a different location than /opt/rocm/hcc2.  U of D. (0.5-4)

060 _X_ Add U of D to hcc2 dev team.  They are building an OpenMP test suite for all 
        functionality. 

061 _X_ [BUILD] Add sm_70 to default list of NVPTXGPU. (0.5-4)

062 ___ [TEST] (Jan 0.5-4) Create a new examples directory called "cuda" (for Scott).
        The original directory cuda-open should be for amdgcn targets by default.  
        Examples in cuda directory will not work on amdgcn. 
        Examples in cuda-open will use host hip API with native cuda kernels. 

063 _X_ [TEST] Example of linking .a archive of bundled .o (Andrey)

064 ___ [TEST] Example of meaningful usage of task in target region (Andrey)

065 ___ [BUILD] Add gfx906 to default GFXLIST, as well as check its support in the clang/llvm

066 ___ [BUG] Undefined refernce to cbrt() in lulesh-mp4 (Grge 0.5-4)

067 ___ [DRIVER] Fix issue#9 - add support to link with archive of bundled .o-files (lib.a). 
        The issue can be reproduced using test/smoke/liba_bundled (Grge 0.5-4)

068 _X_ [BUILD] Split build_libdevice.sh into build_libm.sh and build_libdevice.sh.
        
068.a ___ [BUILD] The build folder for build_libdevice.sh should be defined by BUILD_HCC2 (the same 
        way as it is done for the other components.

069 ___ [BUILD] Add Opencl runtime to build process

070 ___ [BUILD] Create examples/opencl to show how to compile and execute opencl applications with HCC2
         Consider using the clang-ocl bash script to compile and execute.  

071 ___ [TEST] Create examples/openmp_hip/matrixmul to demonstrate OpenMP+HIP.   This will not use target 
        offload. It will use OpenMP just for CPU parallelism of launching HIP tasks.  (Andrey)

072 ___ [TEST] Create examples/openmp_hip to demonstrate MPI+OpenMP+HIP using gcc (Andrey)

073 _X_  [BUILD] Move to latest version of rocm-device-libs (Greg 0.5-5) 
           Also get rid of build of prepare-builtins which is causing fails in the build. 
           prepare-buildins is built in the utils. 

100 ___ Move this list to Git Issues when things slow down.
